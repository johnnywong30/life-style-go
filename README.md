# life-style-go

REST API for life-style app using Python, GraphQL, and MongoDB

## Mission Statement

User focused API to act as a life style companion to track exercise and diets. Python will be the primary language to build a server to host the API. GraphQL will be used to query data from the FDC Food API and/or our MongoDB. This queries will be cached in Redis to improve access speed. Eventually a Front End will be built to better display all of this data, but that's a later problem.
